# Accessible ACF Accordion Block by Kinetic Iris

This is a plugin that creates an accessbile accordion block. It requires ACF Pro in order to work.

ACF Blocks are registered via the plugin and set up as a parent/child block pair. 

## To Use
Download a zip of this repo and use the Upload Plugin button under Add New Plugin. Upload the zipped file.

This is a copy of the accordion used on the Overnight Website and it is encouraged that you change the styles and icons to match your branding. 

I also make no guarantees about this plugin and is currently offered as-is. Open to suggestions, and feel free to report any bugs.
